Simple JavaScript web character generator for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th edition.

I just cobbled a quick javascript web page to generate random characters. Current version can roll
everything for you or allow you a few simple selections (Race, Reroll or simple "one or another" Talent/Skill choices).

Remade some choices from original for personal game style
